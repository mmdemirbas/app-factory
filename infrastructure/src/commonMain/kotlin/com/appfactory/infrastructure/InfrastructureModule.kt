 * Phase 1 placeholder.

 * Phase 4 (backend + Supabase), Phase 5 (sync), and Phase 6 (connectors).
 *
 * When adapters are added:
 *  - Each adapter implements a port interface from :domain
 *  - Adapters are registered in Koin modules per platform
 *  - No adapter class imports from :domain.common beyond the allowed types
