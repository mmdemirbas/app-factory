# Current work: Phase 7 — User System

## Goal
Implement unified team & user model allowing collaborative multi-tenant configurations of the meta-app, replacing single-owner limits.

## Definition of done for Phase 7
- [x] Base `User` and `Team` entity domain models created.
- [x] Connectors and mapping references updated to belong to `TeamId` instead of global singletons.
- [x] Team switching UI implemented.
- [x] Access control limits API access purely to a user's active team.
